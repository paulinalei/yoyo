Worked with a group of three people, including myself, that developed a webpage that would host articles for the graduation issue for the Daily Bruin in the 2015-2016 school year.
Graduation issue is the last issue of the year where the Daily Bruin publishes articles and multimedia projects that summarize the school year.
