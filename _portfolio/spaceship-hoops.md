Worked with four other people to create a graphics game using WebGL.
The point of the game is to get as many points by going through rings and dodging meteors.
The game gets progressively harder the longer you last in the game as we make the speed of the meteors come faster
towards the user.

For this project, we implemented collision detection, bump mapping, and simulating smoke.

For the meteors, we loaded in obj files that we found online to create a more realistic meteor.
