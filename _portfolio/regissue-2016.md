This was a website to hold all the articles written for the registration issue for the Daily Bruin. I worked with three
other members to develop this site. This issue is a special issue that the Daily Bruin publishes to celebrate the start
of the new school year.

We pulled the data using an Excel spreadsheet

The slideshows were from SlickJS.
