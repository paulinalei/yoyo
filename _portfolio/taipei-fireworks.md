I wanted to create an online representation of fireworks going off with the Taipei city skyline.

To draw the elements, I used ProcessingJS.
This allowed me to use a more object oriented approach to rendering and drawing elements onto the canvas.
Processing provided event handlers for clicking and had an animation frame rate that allowed me to animate movement.

During development, I used NodeJS and Jade.

Gif created using Gyazo.
