I'm an avid lover of ice cream, so I decided to make a website using the Google Maps JavaScript API to mark all the ice
cream stores I've been to in addition to displaying my review and rating for each place.

Users can click on a pin to see my review and rating for a specific ice cream place or they can use the sidebar menu
to select a specific store. Then, the map would pan to the specific store and display the data associated with it.

This was my first time using an API, so it was nice that Google provided such easy-to-read documentation to help me
get set up with my project.
