I'll be using this blog post to keep track of what I've learned while making this website.

## Jekyll specific issues
I used Jekyll to make this website. I had been toying with the idea of making my website a full-stack web application, but ultimately one of my friends convinced me to use Jekyll.

Reasons I decided to use Jekyll:
* pretty URLS
* Markdown pages
* statically generated website
* easy templating
* hosted on GitHub

Overall, I am really glad my friend told me to use Jekyll. Definitely made the process of making my website smooth and I got to learn something new!

### Routing
I pushed this to a project repository instead of using the user repository that GitHub provides. This caused a lot of issues in terms of figuring out paths.

I also used collections to make subroutes to generate separate webpages for my portfolio projects.

## Responsive Design
### Sass
I learned Sass. This definitely made styling so much easier. Why didn't I learn this earlier?

### IsotopeJS
Using Isotope for my portfolio grid.

I had initally set specific width and height to make my grid elements squares. But this caused some issues in formatting the grid and making it responsive.
Using relative widths now.

## Using a DNS
First time buying a domain!

Before, I had used UCLA's online hosting service and had a domain with bol.ucla.edu. It was nice to learn how to do this myself. I purchased a domain name via Namecheap and easily found resources to get my website up and running!
